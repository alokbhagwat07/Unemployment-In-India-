India Education–Industry Mismatch Analysis:

This project analyzes the alignment between educational output and industry demand across Indian states by comparing the number of colleges and companies in various sectors.
The goal is to identify skill shortages, oversupply regions, balanced states, and sectoral gaps to understand India’s demand–supply landscape.

Objective:

To evaluate the demand–supply mismatch between:
Supply → Number of colleges providing sector-specific education.
Demand → Number of companies operating in each sector.

Mismatch Score →

data{Difference} = data{Company %} - data{College %}
A positive score = industry demand is higher → skill shortage.
A negative score = colleges are more than required → skill oversupply.
A value near 0 = balanced sector.

Tech Stack

1)Python
2)Pandas
3)NumPy
4)Matplotlib & Seaborn
5)Plotly / Folium / GeoPandas
6)Jupyter Notebook

Project Workflow:

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing.
Standardized sector and state names.
Handled missing values
Converted counts into percentages
Calculated mismatch (demand–supply difference)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

State-wise and sector-wise distribution.
Share of colleges vs companies.
Ranking of mismatch.
Identifying top balanced states.

Visualizations:

Side-by-side bar charts (College % vs Company %)
Heatmaps showing mismatch across states & sectors
India Choropleth Map highlighting mismatch severity
State-level demand–supply graphs
Top mismatched & balanced states

Key Insights:

States with high positive mismatch → severe skill shortages
States with negative mismatch → oversupply of graduates
Certain sectors show strong demand but very limited educational capacity
A few states show excellent balance between education and industry

Project Outcome:

This project provides a data-driven understanding of India’s skill ecosystem, helping identify where educational institutions need expansion or restructuring.
It demonstrates strong capabilities in:

✔ Data Cleaning
✔ EDA
✔ Visualization
✔ Storytelling
✔ Geospatial Mapping
✔ Decision-making Insights

Perfect for Data Analyst / Data Science portfolios.
